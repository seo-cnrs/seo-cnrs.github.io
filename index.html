<p>I am a permanently posted <a href="http://www.cnrs.fr/">CNRS</a> (French National Scientific Research Center) Research director with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation">HDR</a> degree (The highest academic degree in France that allows you to be a supervisor for PhD candidates) working at <a href="http://icube.unistra.fr/">ICube</a> (Laboratoire des sciences de l&apos;ing&eacute;nieur, de l&apos;informatique et de l&apos;imagerie), Universit&eacute; de Strasbourg. For those who are not familiar with French research system, it is a post equivalent to tenured university professor, with no teaching obligation. Since 2016, I am also an affiliated professor at POSTECH, South Korea.</p>
<p>I was educated in South Korea and hold BSc and MSc degrees in computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). After obtaining the PhD degree at the University of Geneva (MIRALab) in 2004, I became an assistant professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Chungnam National University, South Korea. During the period of 2004-2009, I had been supervisor of the Computer Graphics Laboratory there until I moved to France.</p>
<p>My research interest centers primarily around 3D/4D shape analysis (shape similarity, segmentation, correspondence finding, etc.) and modeling (representation, reconstruction, etc.), with focus on human data. I have also worked on data-driven (learning-based) methods for shape estimation and motion generation, texture mapping, and sketch-based shape reconstruction, among others. So far, I have authored about 60 published articles in international journals and conferences, 4 book chapters, and 3 patents.</p>
<p>I have served several editorial boards for international journals, among them is The Visual Computer journal (Springer Nature) where I have been an associate editor-in-chief (2016-2020). I also serve as PC member or reviewer for several international conferences, have participated in the organization of several international conferences including Eurographics 2014 (Strasbourg, local organization member), Computer Graphics International 2015 (Strasbourg, conference co-chair), Symposium on Solid and Physical Modeling 2020 (on-line, conference co-chair), and Shape Modeling International 2021 (on-line, local organization chair). During 2012-2016, I worked for the national committee of CNRS as an elected member.</p>
<p>Since 2021, I am co-leading a new research team <a href="http://mlms.icube.unistra.fr">Machine Learning, Modeling & Simulation (MLMS)</a>.</p>
